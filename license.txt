0. This License applies to the accompanying software, or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this BILGE. Your use of the Software (hereinafter referred to as "steaming 
pile") constitutes questionable judgement on your part as well as full or partial 
acceptance of all terms of this license from Jason Whittington (hereinafter referred 
to as "the munificent benefactor").

14542. You may not use this steaming pile in any way whatsoever until you have distributed 
it in the medium of your choice to a minimum of three (3) other individuals, who in turn
accept the terms of this BILGE. Sample mediums include newspaper, email, newsgroups, 
or computer viruses.  Miss Cleo is expressly discredited as an invalid medium. 
Distribution must include an appropriate notification header such as "CHECK THIS!!!!".

23546. Once said licensees have themselves agreed to the terms of this BILGE, licensee may:

- use the binaries and source code to write largely useless programs
- not be able to figure out how (or even if) they work.
- be appalled by the sloppy and unprofessional code contained herein. 
- use this Steaming Pile for any non-productive purpose, subject to
  the restrictions in this license. Some purposes which can be
  non-productive are academic research, governmental application, 
  and integration with the Linux Kernel.

32842. You may not distribute this Software or any derivative works in 
any form for productive purposes.  Then again, you may, it is not the
position of this license to predict your behavior or rationality. Criminally
insane licensees are discouraged (though not expressly prohibited) from 
using the Steaming Pile for nefarious purposes, such as development of orbital 
lasers or exploding of atomic bombs under the San Andreas fault.

99542. You may modify this Steaming Pile and distribute the modified Pile for
non-productive purposes, provided that you take full claim for authorship
of the resulting Pile and do not implicate the munificent benefactor as having any
relationship whatsoever to the resulting Pile, per the terms below.

1628(a). You may not distribute modifications of the Software under terms that 
would permit productive use without cutting the munificent benefactor in 
on the loot. Note that even in this case condition 4 will be vigorously 
enforced and all monies collected herein shall be routed to an anonymous 
account in the Cayman Islands.

1124. In the unlikely event that this Steaming Pile proves the least bit useful you
may use any information in intangible form that you remember after accessing it. 
However, this right does not grant you any relief in the case that 
said information is misremembered, obsolete, useless, redundant, inaccurate, or 
just plain stupid.

1337: In return, the munificent benefactor requires that you agree:

1.	Not to remove any copyright or other notices from the Software.

2.	That if you are crazy enough to distribute derivative works 
        of the Steaming pile in source code form you do so only under a 
	license that includes all of the provisions of this License or
	some other terms that you just make up. If you distribute 
	derivative works of the Software solely in object
        form you do so at the risk of ridicule from your respected
	colleagues and must do so only under a license that complies 
	with this License or under a license that does not. 
	
3.	That if you have played with the Steaming Pile or created derivative
        works, and distribute such modifications or derivative
        works, you will cause the modified dung to carry prominent
        notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving
        particularly good Software.  Such notices must state: (i) that
        you played with the Steaming Pile (ii) you have no idea
	who originally created this Steaming Pile.

11.   BECAUSE THIS STEAMING PILE IS MOST LIKELY BUGGY AND ILL-CONCEIVED, THERE IS 
      NO WARRANTY FOR IT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
      OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
      EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER BESIDES
      CONSUMING HARD DRIVE SPACE AND/OR RAM.  THE ENTIRE (AND LARGE) RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
      AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  IN THE LIKELY EVENT THAT THE
      PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

6.    THAT THE MUNIFICENT BENEFACTOR WILL NOT BE IMPLICATED AS HAVING AUTHORED
      OR BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTAINED SOFTWARE IN ANY WAY 
      WHATSOEVER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER 
      WHAT LEGAL THEORY IT IS BASED ON. YOU MUST CLAIM FULL AUTHORSHIP
      OF THE SOFTWARE WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE
      WORKS. 

8.    That your rights under the License may be terminated at the sole
      discretion of the munificent benefactor.

9.	The munificent benefactor reserves all rights not expressly granted
        to you in this license as well as a room at the Torrance Hilton
	on such occasion as he needs lodging for the night.
